# MySQL Servers

##  MySQL-Server vs MariaDB

Most resources for FiveM were designed to be used with MySQL 5.7 and may hit compatibility issues when using MySQL 8, i.e.

- More reserved keywords, like `'stored'` and `'group'`.
- `Longtext` / `JSON` fields do not support default values.
`MariaDB` is **highly recommended** for compatibility, and improved performance (over all versions of MySQL).

## Installation

<Callout type="warning">
    For Development, it is okay to use XAMPP, but for Production, it is **highly** Recommended to install a MariaDB
    Server directly.
</Callout>

    - You will then be asked to <LinkButton text={"Set a Password"} image={"https://i.imgur.com/DPpAbnh.png"}/> for the
    `root` user, this should be a **strong** password, as it is the main user for the database.
    - Once you have set a password, click `Next`.
    - It will then show you <LinkButton text={"this window"} image={"https://i.imgur.com/4ODyyo6.png"}/>, it is
