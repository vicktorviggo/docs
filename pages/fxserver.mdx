## Guide
<Steps>
    ### Installing
    <Callout type="info">
        Before starting, make sure to register a licence key on [<DefinitionText text={"Keymaster"}/>](https://keymaster.fivem.net/)
    </Callout>
    - Head To the [Artifact Download page](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/)

    - Open the extracted folder, it should look like <LinkButton text={"this"} image={"https://i.imgur.com/GSBYUdz.png"}/>

    ### Starting

    - In the extracted folder, find <DefinitionText text={"FXServer.exe"}/> and double click it.
    - <LinkButton text={"This site"} image={"https://i.imgur.com/hz6lUsz.png"}/> should open in your browser, if it does not, open your browser and goto <DefinitionText text={"localhost:40120"}/>.
    - Make sure the PIN is filled in and then press `Link Account`.
    - You will then be prompted to log into your [Cfx.re](https://forum.cfx.re/) account, click `Yes, Allow` once done.
    - You will then be prompted to create a backup password, make sure to remember this.

    ### Setup
    <Callout type="warning">
        For all recipes other than `Cfx Default`, you need to setup a MySQL Server before running. For more information, see [this guide](./fxserver/mysql_setup).
    </Callout>

    - You should now be on <LinkButton text={"this menu"} image={"https://i.imgur.com/5W1I0DW.png"}/>, from here, click
    `Next`.
    - You will then be asked to enter your <LinkButton text={"server's name"} image={"https://i.imgur.com/AEIe9mH.png"}/>, enter it and press `Next`.
    - From here Choose <DefinitionText text={"Popular Templates"}/>
    - This will Give you a <LinkButton text={"list of templates"} image={"https://i.imgur.com/JXUqMIz.png"}/> to choose from.
        - <DefinitionText text={"Cfx Default"}/> *(FiveM)*
        - [<DefinitionText text={"ESX Legacy"}/>](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx_core) *(FiveM)*
        - [<DefinitionText text={"QB-Core"}/>](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core) *(FiveM)*
        - <DefinitionText text={"Cfx Default"}/> *(RedM)*
        - [<DefinitionText text={"VORP Core"}/>](https://github.com/VORPCORE/vorp-core-lua) *(RedM)*

    - Select the one you want to use *(Make sure it matches the game you are using)*.
    - For this Tutorial, we will be selecting **CFX Default**.
    - Once selected, Press `Save` and then Head to the `Recipe Deployer`!

    ### Deploying

    - The Recipe Deployer will take you to an <LinkButton text={"overview"} image={"https://i.imgur.com/wksaWEE.png"}/> of the Recipe selected.
    - By default, these should be correct, so scroll to the bottom and press `Next`.
    - It will then ask for your [<DefinitionText text={"Keymaster"}/>](https://keymaster.fivem.net/) Licence Key.
      > Note: if your recipe requires a database, you may need to enter use the <LinkButton text={"Advanced Settings"} image={"https://i.imgur.com/XFuUBqz.png"}/> tab to change the database details.
    - Once Entered, Press `Run Recipe`.
    - This will start installing your server!
    - once it has finished, click `Save & Run Server`.
    - you will then be taken to the txAdmin dashboard, and your server is now setup!
